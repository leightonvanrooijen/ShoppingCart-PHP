# ShoppingCart-PHP

### Info
php: v7.4.9
jquery and ajax from google api

### Project Scope

* The cart will need to keep its “state” during page loads / refreshes
* List Products – these should be listed at all times to allow adding of products
* Products should be listed in this format: product name, price, link to add product
* Must be able to add a product to the cart
* Must be able to view current products in the cart
* Cart products should be listed in this format: product name, price, quantity, total, remove link
* Product totals should be tallied to give an overall total
* Must be able to remove a product from the cart
* Adding an existing product will only update existing cart product quantity (e.g. adding the same product twice will NOT create two cart items)
* All prices should be displayed to 2 decimal places
* Error checking will be set to strict for viewing completed code
* Project will work as expected in PHP 7.0+

### Future updates

* User authentication (login) like (https://github.com/leightonvanrooijen/merng-social-server)

* Whats the best pratice for storing the float? See $price storage
